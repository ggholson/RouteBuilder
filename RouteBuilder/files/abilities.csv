Fails against bosses. ",32
111,"Odin",4,"Odin's attack is strongly influenced by the Odin's Sword Support Ability. First, Odin will attempt to inflict KO status on all enemies. The base chance is the amount of Ore in your inventory divided by 2 and expressed as a percentage, then modified by the difference between one-quarter Dagger's Magic stat and her Level minus the enemy's Level. At this point, if Odin's Sword is not equipped, or if all enemies were KO'd successfully, the attack ends; otherwise, the Odin's Sword ability causes Odin to use a damage attack (base power = 145 - Ore in inventory) on all enemies that weren't KO'd. With a low Ore count this can potentially out-power even Ark, but you may not want to spend the stones on Odin's Sword, depending on your strategy. ",28
112,"Leviathan",4,"Deals heavy (59 base power) Water-elemental damage to all enemies. ",42
113,"Bahamut",4,"Deals heavy (88 base power) non-elemental damage to all enemies. ",56
114,"Ark",4,"Deals extreme (106 base power) Shadow-elemental damage to all enemies. With even a small stack of Lapis Lazuli in your inventory and the long animation, Ark is the strongest normal-damage-formula attack in the game and hits all enemies (it even outpowers Madeen, although Ark is of an inferior element). You can also cheese out the long animation version especially: equip everyone with Auto-Regen and Dagger with Boost, then Summon Ark anytime your HP gets low and don't enter the menu. Everyone will Regen most of their lost HP, after which the enemy will take heavy damage. This attack rocks, and is frankly one of the only reasons to bother with Dagger after Eiko joins up (the other is Bahamut, which is likewise capable of out-powering Madeen and is non-elemental). ",80
115,"Fenrir",4,"Normally, Fenrir deals medium (42 base power) Earth-elemental damage to all enemies. However, if Eiko has a Maiden Prayer equipped, Fenrir deals medium (44 base power) Wind-elemental damage to all enemies. ",30
116,"Phoenix",4,"Revives all KO'd allies (the amount of HP they will have is dependent on the ally's Spirit stat) and hits all enemies for medium (40 base power) Fire-elemental damage (not increased by any Gem). In addition, if the entire party is KO'd and Eiko is in the party, there is a chance Phoenix will be Summoned as a final attack (the chance increases depending on the number of Phoenix Pinions in your inventory), reviving all allies but dealing no damage to the enemy party and costing no MP. ",32
117,"Carbuncle",4,"Summons Carbuncle, which buffs your party based upon Eiko's equipped Add-on",24
118,"Madeen",4,"Deals heavy (71 base power) Holy-elemental damage to all enemies. ",54

141,"Jewel",5,"Extracts one Ore from target and adds it to inventory (50% base accuracy). This can be done as often as you like (enemies will never ""run out""). ",4
